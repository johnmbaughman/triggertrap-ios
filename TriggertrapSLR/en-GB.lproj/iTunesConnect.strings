/* What's New in This Version */
"iTunes Connet - What's New in This Version"="All new, all shiny, still red - Triggertrap Mobile 4.0. We’ve completely rewritten the core of our app to improve speed, efficiency, and accuracy. We find those things pretty exciting, but we’ve also we’ve been beavering away on new features, including the single most requested feature: night mode.\n\nTo turn Triggertrap Mobile into the perfect companion for photography in the dark, a simple switch lives in the settings section of the app. The colours have been chosen to be subtle yet clear in darkness, and not dazzle you when you use the app, making it ideal for high speed photography in studios, light painting in the garden, and for astrophotography in the field. These colours are designed to work with the screen brightness turned right down, minimising light coming out the phone, and maximising battery life.\n\nBut we’ve not just painted it black. Wearables mode has been taken to the next level, with support for every mode except Press and Hold and Quick Release. This makes it perfect for starting sensor modes from a distance so you don’t accidently trigger them yourself, keeping your long exposure HDRs sharp and your star trails steady.\n\nMotion and Vibration sensors have both benefited from a lower latency audio buffer (exciting!), and we’ve also focused on making the app more battery-efficient so you can timelapse for longer, thanks to cleaner code, simpler animations, and more dynamic decision making within the app’s logic.\n\nAs ever, our bug-crush shoes have also been out in force, stamping out bugs far too numerous (and boring) to mention here.\n\nAny feedback or suggestions? We love to hear what you think, please send us an email to hello@tri.gg to let us know!";
